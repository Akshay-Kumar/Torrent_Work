# FileBot Script Repository

FileBot makes scripting and automation as easy as it gets. 
Just script everything in Groovy instead of bothering with 
cumbersome cmd and bash scripts. It's the same on all platforms 
and much more powerful. The provided functions are the same as 
in the CLI and parameter usage is also exactly the same.

## Clone
If you want to run scripts from a local file or if you want to make your own modifications just clone the repository into your local filesystem:
```
git clone https://github.com/filebot/scripts.git
```
You can call local Groovy scripts by specifiying the filepath:
```
filebot -script /path/to/script.groovy
```
